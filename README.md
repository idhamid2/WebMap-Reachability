# Reachability - Web Map Application

The "**Web Map Application**"  integrates the open-source libraries such as [Leaflet - Maps](https://leafletjs.com/), and [Leaflet Reachability plugin](https://github.com/traffordDataLab/leaflet.reachability) .

The web-map appliation provides the following functionalities;
- Show areas of reachability based on time or distance for different modes of travel using the [Openrouteservice isochrones API](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/v2/isochrones/%7Bprofile%7D/post)
- Allow users to define the origin point for reachability analysis.
- Enable selecting different travel modes and timeframes for analysis.

The result of application indicates following;
- "**Travel Time**" to each data point from a user-defined origin (considering different travel modes like driving, walking, public transport).
- "**Service Area**" reachable within a specific timeframe from a central location.
